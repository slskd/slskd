Per CONTRIBUTING.md:

# Contributing

All contributions must have first been discussed within an Issue or Discussion.  Pull Requests opened without an accompanying Issue are considered to be unsolicited, and unsolicited Pull Requests may be rejected without review and/or converted into an Issue.

## Copyright

By submitting a contribution to this project, you agree to the following:

* You have the legal right to make this contribution and to assign its copyright.
* You irrevocably assign all copyright and related rights in your contribution to the project maintainer(s).
* You grant the project maintainer(s) the right to use, modify, distribute, and relicense your contribution under any license of their choosing.

This application is currently released under the [AGPL 3.0](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

## Use of AI in Contributions

If you used AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.) to assist with your contribution, you must clearly disclose this in your Pull Request, including:

* Which AI tool(s) you used
* How you used them (e.g., code generation, refactoring suggestions, documentation help)
* Which parts of your contribution were AI-assisted

Contributors are expected to fully understand and take responsibility for all code they submit, regardless of how it was produced.  Contributions made entirely by AI are not welcome and will be rejected.
